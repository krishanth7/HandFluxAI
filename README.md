## 📐 Enterprise Architecture

The system is architected for maximum separation of concerns:

1.  **Perception Layer**: Handles raw frame acquisition and landmark extraction.
2.  **Intelligence Layer**: Interprets spatial data into semantic system intents.
3.  **Action Layer**: Translates intents into high-level OS commands with jitter-reduction filtering.

For detailed technical deep-dives, please refer to the [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md).
